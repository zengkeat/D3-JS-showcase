			<h4>Visualizing Global Per Capita CO2 Emissions</h4>

			<p>
				<b>Summary:</b> Measuring a country total carbon emission without considered its population doesn't always paint the most accurate image 
				of their contribution. For example, despite many developing countries like China, India, and Russia are some of the highest emitter of CO2 in the world, 
				but its per-capital emission is much less than many countries like US, Canada, Europe etc. Thus, looking at the CO2 emission per-capita can add 
				nuance to the overall story.

				<li><b>Domain:</b> Scientist, Entrepreneur, or Organizations working on reduce carbon emession or solving climate change.</li>
				<li><b>Data:</b> 
					<ul>
						<li><b>Domain description:</b> Population of the country or regional, and thier carbon emissions per-capital.</li> 
						<li><b>Abstraction:</b> 
							<ul>
								<li>Dataset type: Tabular</li>
								<li>Attribute 1: Country, Type: Categorical , Cardinality: Total 33 countries</li>
								<li>Attribute 2: Region, Type: Categorical , Cardinality: Total 4 Regions</li>
								<li>Attribute 3: Population, Type: Ordered(Quantitative) , Cardinality: range from 0 to 7.5 billions, 
									Special Properties: sequential</li>
								<li>Attribute 4: Carbon Emissions Per Capita of the country or region, Type: Ordered(Quantitative), 
									Cardinality: range from 0 to 19.5, Special Properties: sequential arrange from max to min</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Task:</b>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Domain description:</b> The purpose of this visualization is to paint a fair and accurate 
							picture of country's carbon emissions by focus on their per-capital emission rather than total emission.</li> 
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Idiom:</b> The visualization is a bar chart in its core where each bar represent a country/regional; The height (y-axis) represent the CO2 emissions(0 to 20 tonnes per year); and the width (x-axis) represent the population(0 to 7.5 billions).
					The author clever utilization of graphic, color and chart manipulation into a circular form allow the population and CO2 emissions per-capital of 33 country being see in a glance.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<b>Personal Thoughts</b> I think this is an interesting visualization because of how intuitive and informative it is. The visualization is able to 
				fit both population and emission per-capital of 33 country without making it complicated and hard to process. I like how it able to show each country
				population and its emission per-capital both inside one bar/area. And the circular representation not only make the chart much shorter in length, it also make
				it easier to compare emission per-capital between countries in a glance.
