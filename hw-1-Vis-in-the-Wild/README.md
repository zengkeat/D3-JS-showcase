# Homework #1: Vis in the Wild

The purpose of this assignment is to get you thinking about visualization from a design persepective and to give you a bit of practice and exposure to making a web page (programming in HTML and CSS).

You should find a visualization online somewhere that you think is interesting. Don't just pick a basic bar chart or scatter plot, but look around and see if you can find something more interesting that is especially attractive, insightful, moving, or interesting.

Once you've found the chart you want to use, take a screenshot of it. Modify the index.html page in this repository to describe the visualization, and commit/push the updated page back to this repository to submit your assignment.

- Add your name, email, a title for the chart (or the title of the page you took it from)
- Replace the picture of Sparky with a screenshot of the visualization.
- Update the URL to point to the page where you found the visualization.

Next, replace the Lorem Ipsum text on the page with a brief (one paragraph) description of the visualization. Below that, add the following information:

- **Domain abstraction**: Who are the likely intended users for this visualization?
- **Data**
  - **Domain Descrption**: What is the dataset being shown here? Briefly describe it (1-2 sentences is fine) using domain-language.
  - **Abstraction:** Describe the dataset using the data abstraction lanaguage (see the Data Abstraction lecture). What is the dataset type? Then, for each visaulized attribute, what are its properties (cardinality, attribute type, etc.)?
- **Task**: 
  - **Domain Description**: Describe the task(s) that the visualilzation can support (1-2 sentences is fine), using domain-language.
  - **Abstraction (Optional)**: Describe the tasks supported by the visualization using the task abstraction language (see the Task Abstraction lecture).
- **Idiom**: In your own words, describe the visualization and (if applicable) the interactions. In other words, what visualization technique is being used? If you are not sure what the name of the technique is, you can describe how the data is being visually encoded or shown on the page.
- (You can skip the Algoirthm part for this assignment.)
- **Personal Thoughts**: Do you think this is a good and/or interesting visualization? Why or why not? What do you like about it?
